One source states that on average, Google hires [1 employee out of every 130 applicants](https://www.smartrecruiters.com/blog/google-averages-130-applicants-to-make-one-hire/), or about 0.7%. In his book titled _Work Rules_, Google’s SVP (Senior Vice President) of People Operations (basically Human Resources) states:\r\n\r\nMollit nisi cillum exercitation minim officia velit laborum non Lorem\r\nadipisicing dolore.

Give them as many as you're comfortable with. Email would be the most common.\r\n-   **Resume.** Your portfolio will allow you to elaborate more on your work experience, education, and project history, but you should still include a downloadable link to your resume in whatever format you choose (I prefer .pdf) for convenience.\r\n-   **Your skills.** What programming languages are you proficient in? Which ones do you have experience with? What libraries or frameworks have you used? Are you a master of any certain software? These are all great things to include to show your technical aptitude. Be cautious though: this shouldn’t be a list of every programming language or buzzword you can think of. A lot of employers will treat anything on your resume or portfolio as fair game when it comes to a technical interview. If you’ve only used C++ for one school project, you might not want to include that.\r\n-   **Information about yourself.** Use this opportunity to let your personality shine and let the user learn about you. If they’re considering hiring you, they want to be sure they’d enjoy working with you on a daily basis. Include some of your hobbies and what you like to do in your free time. However, don’t just say “I like to code”. I would hope you like to code, and your portfolio should speak for that, but you don’t need to explicitly say it.\r\n-   **Social media profiles.** If you professionally use social media, include them. If you don’t have a GitHub account, it’s time to make one.\r\n-   **Projects.** This may or may not apply to you. For current students and new grads, this is an opportunity to show you understand how to program even though you might not have a lot of real world experience. This gives the employer tangible examples of your work. Anyone can say they understand a programming language, but a complex project on your GitHub profile goes a lot farther than a simple bullet point.\r\n-   **Blog (optional).** Personally, I love portfolios that contain blog posts. Communication is such a major factor in determining whether or not you will get hired. The bottom line is: if you can’t communicate effectively, you probably won’t succeed. Showing your literacy through blog posts helps the employer see you’re an effective written communicator and also shows you’re passionate about something. Your blog posts don’t have to be technical. Write about whatever you enjoy.\r\n\r\n<ImageMDX\r\n    src={\"/Capture1.png\"}\r\n    alt={\"Des Moines, Iowa\"}\r\n    priority\r\n    layout={\"intrinsic\"}\r\n    width={720}\r\n    height={405}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n## Choosing A Design\r\n\r\nIt’s finally time to start creating your portfolio! At this time, you should have a rough idea of what you want things to look like. Depending on your proficiency with HTML/CSS/Javascript, you have the option of designing your website from scratch. However, my first approach was by starting off from a template. There’s quite a few advantages of using a template.\r\n\r\n-   It’s already responsive, meaning it will work on desktop or mobile.\r\n-   Most developers aren’t also designers. Designing is tough.\r\n-   It lowers the barrier to entry for beginning web developers.\r\n-   Ultimately, it saves you time and makes your life easier.\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\nimport * as React from \"react\";\r\nimport Box from \"@mui/material/Box\";\r\n\r\nexport default function BoxSx() {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeserunt officia do nulla Lorem consequat non nostrud officia officia nulla.
