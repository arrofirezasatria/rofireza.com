Largest Contentful Paint or LCP is the time during the page load process when the largest page element is rendered within viewport. LCP is one of three charateristic
measure of core web vital Google uses as part of its search rankings, along with Cumulative Layout Shift and First Input Delay.

Is common LCP is to be element of image.

using priority in LCP image

1. Use the height and width attributes on your Image component in Next.js or <img> element in HTML to prevent layout shift. Adding these attributes to your markup will tell the browser how much space to allocate.
2. Do not Lazy-load LCP Images
   Not lazy loading the LCP image helps it load faster because the browser will just process it normally as it's encountered in the markup.
   This is better for your LCP timing and makes your page appear visually complete to the user much earlier in the page load.
   To achive this in next js you can set Image component = priority='true'

    <Image priority="true" />

3. Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF).
