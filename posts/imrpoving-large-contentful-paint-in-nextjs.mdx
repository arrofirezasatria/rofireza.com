[Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) or LCP is the time during the page load process when the largest page element is rendered within viewport. LCP is one of three charateristic
measure of core web vital Google uses as part of its search rankings, along with
[Comulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)
and
[First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/).

Is common LCP is to be element of image.

There are several ways to optimize LCP Image in Next JS :

1. Use the height and width attributes on your Image component in Next.js or element in HTML to prevent layout shift. Adding these attributes to your markup will tell the browser how much space to allocate.

### 2. Do not Lazy-load LCP Images

Not lazy loading the LCP image helps it load faster because the browser will just process it normally as it's encountered in the markup.
To achive this in Next js you can set Image component [priority='true'](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#priority) see the [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#priority)

```javascript
<Image
    priority={true}
    src="me.png"
    alt="Picture of the author"
    width={500}
    height={500}
/>
```
