[Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) or LCP is the time during the page load process when the largest page element is rendered within viewport. LCP is one of three charateristic
measure of core web vital Google uses as part of its search rankings, along with
[Comulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/)
and
[First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/).

### 1. Use Image Component

[Next JS Image Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) is powerful image optimization which able
to improve the core web vitals and SEO performance. Some technique usually is hard to manually setting like scrset and blur placeholder
which is easy to setup in Next JS.

Some of the optimizations from the based on [Doc](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) is :

-   **Improved Performance:** Always serve correctly sized image for each device, using modern image formats

    <ImageMDX
        height={200}
        width={460}
        src="https://ik.imagekit.io/rofireza/Blog/scrset_nextjs_devmode_wisxCALbq.jpg?ik-sdk-version=javascript-1.4.3&updatedAt=1663095529596"
        alt="LCP Image Simulation"
    />

    As you can see Next JS generate image of each screen size and generate when build time, make sure url image source available
    through `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`.

-   **Visual Stability:** Prevent [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/cls) automatically
-   **Faster Page Loads:** Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport, with optional blur-up placeholders
-   **Asset Flexibility:** On-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers

### 2. Preload LCP Images

Preload the LCP image helps it load faster because the browser will just process it normally as it's encountered in the markup.
To achive this in Next js you can set Image component [priority='true'](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#priority).

```javascript
<Image
    priority={true}
    src="me.png"
    alt="Picture of the author"
    width={500}
    height={500}
/>
```

When true, the image will be considered high priority and preload. Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using priority. Its also posible to priority more than one image

### 2. Use CDN

If you are using hosting platfrom like vercel its include in build in CDN, But if you re hosting from vps you need to setup for yourself

### 3. Avoid using Video

    If you put a video on above fold it will download the resource until its done,  usually the file size is large. to overcome this you need to make
    image video placeholder and then prevent video to load before some condition.

### 4. Use Image Blur Placeholder

    Blur Placeholder is use while the image is loading. Next JS Build in Image placeholder when you use from static image.
    For dynamic images, you must provide the blurDataURL property. Solutions such as Plaiceholder can help with base64 generation.
    You can also learn how to implement from this post [Post](https://rofireza.com/posts/creating-blur-placeholder-images-using-NextJS-and-Plaiceholder)

    ```javascript
    <Image
        src="me.png"
        alt="Picture of the author"
        width={500}
        height={500}
        placeholder="blur"
        blurDataURL={base64BlurImage}
    />
    ```

    any blurry preview, e.g. a blurhash or a 1:32 resolution image, or a WebP2 triangular preview, etc. This phase is useful to make it clear that an image is going to appear here, to avoid layout jank, and to prevent flash.
